## Abstract

Ecologists often rely on unique natural markings to identify
individual free-ranging animals without disturbing them.
We developed a computer-aided photo-identification system
for identifying polar bears (*Ursus maritimus*)
based on whisker spot pattern recognition.
We automated our system so that the selection of 3 reference points
on the input image is the only manual step required
during image preprocessing.
Our pattern-matching algorithm is unique in that the variability
within spot patterns is considered fully
rather than representing them as points
and applying a point-pattern matching algorithm.
We also measured the reliability of our method as probabilities
of true positives and false positives using photographs
of various qualities taken at different angles.
When we excluded photographs of poor quality and angle
the probability of true positives was >80%
at a false positive probability of 10%.
A new photograph could be preprocessed in <1 min
and tested against a reference library of 100 individuals in <10 min.
Our computer-aided identification system could be extended for use
in other species with variable spot patterns,
which could be useful in efforts to estimate various
population dynamics parameters essential for the study
and conservation of wildlife,
particularly threatened and endangered species.
